          FIELD FORMAT:
          ${format}

          ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS FOR THIS QUARTER:
          1. Must fill ALL ${positionsPerQuarter} field positions
          2. Must-play players (if any) MUST be assigned to positions
          3. All other positions can be filled with any available players
          4. GOALKEEPER CONSECUTIVE RULE: If a player was GK in the previous quarter (Q${quarterNumber - 1}), they MUST be GK again in Q${quarterNumber} to maintain consecutive goalkeeper quarters

          üö® ERROR HANDLING:
          If you CANNOT create a valid lineup (not enough eligible players, impossible to meet constraints, etc.):
          - Set error: true
          - Provide errorMessage explaining why
          - Do NOT provide quarter data

          üéØ POSITION ASSIGNMENT STRATEGY:
          - Each player has "positionHistory" showing specific position experience (e.g., {"RB": 12, "CB": 4})
          - ALWAYS assign players to their MOST FREQUENT position from history
          - Example: {"RB": 12, "CB": 4, "LB": 1} ‚Üí assign to RB
          - Position abbreviations match the "Position mapping" provided
          - If positionHistory is null, use preferredPositions
          - CONSISTENCY: When possible, keep players in the same position they played in previous quarters of THIS GAME for continuity


          Return the quarter lineup if possible, or an error if constraints cannot be met.`;
