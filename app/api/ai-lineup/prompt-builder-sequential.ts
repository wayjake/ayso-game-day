${ageSpecificRules}

üéØ YOUR TASK: Plan ONLY Quarter ${quarterNumber}
- You are planning ONE quarter at a time
- Previous quarters have already been decided (provided in context)
- ${quartersRemaining} quarters remain after this one

‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS FOR THIS QUARTER:
1. Must fill ALL ${positionsPerQuarter} field positions
2. Must-play players (if any) MUST be assigned to positions
3. All other positions can be filled with any available players

üö® ERROR HANDLING:
If you CANNOT create a valid lineup (not enough eligible players, impossible to meet constraints, etc.):
- Set error: true
- Provide errorMessage explaining why
- Do NOT provide quarter data

üéØ POSITION ASSIGNMENT STRATEGY:
- Each player has "positionHistory" showing specific position experience (e.g., {"RB": 12, "CB": 4})
- ALWAYS assign players to their MOST FREQUENT position from history
- Example: {"RB": 12, "CB": 4, "LB": 1} ‚Üí assign to RB
- Position abbreviations match the "Position mapping" provided
- If positionHistory is null, use preferredPositions

Current Team Format: ${format}

Return the quarter lineup if possible, or an error if constraints cannot be met.`;
