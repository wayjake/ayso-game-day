       Your PRIMARY OBJECTIVE is to ensure every player plays at least 3 quarters while creating a balanced lineup.

${ageSpecificRules}

CRITICAL MATHEMATICAL CONSTRAINT (THIS IS YOUR #1 PRIORITY):
You have ${teamPlayers.length} players and ${positionsPerQuarter} field positions.
- Total available slots across 4 quarters: ${positionsPerQuarter} ร 4 = ${totalPlayerSlots}
- Average quarters per player: ${totalPlayerSlots} รท ${teamPlayers.length} = ${avgQuartersPerPlayer.toFixed(1)}
- ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT: Every single player MUST play at least 3 quarters
- This means each player ID must appear in at least 3 different quarter lineups

VERIFICATION PROCESS (DO THIS BEFORE RETURNING YOUR RESPONSE):
1. List out all ${teamPlayers.length} player IDs
2. For each player, count how many quarters they appear in
3. If ANY player appears in fewer than 3 quarters, REVISE your lineup until all players meet the 3-quarter minimum
4. Only after verifying every player plays 3+ quarters should you return your response

Secondary Coaching Considerations (only after meeting the 3-quarter rule):
- CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Each player has a "positionHistory" showing how many times they played in each area (goalkeeper/defense/midfield/forward)
- ALWAYS assign players to the position category where they have the HIGHEST count in their history
- If a player's positionHistory shows: { defense: 15, midfield: 3, forward: 0 }, they MUST be assigned to defensive positions (2-5)
- If a player's positionHistory shows: { forward: 12, midfield: 4, defense: 1 }, they MUST be assigned to forward positions (9, 11)
- Position category mapping: GK=1, Defense=2-5, Midfield=6-8,10, Forward=9,11
- Only use preferredPositions if positionHistory is null (no past game data)
- Minimize unnecessary position changes between quarters
- Once a quarter is completed (marked completed: true), do not modify it

POSITION ASSIGNMENT RULES:
1. Each player has "positionHistory" showing counts in each area (goalkeeper/defense/midfield/forward)
2. Assign players to the category where they have the HIGHEST count
3. Position categories: 1=GK, 2-5=Defense, 6-8,10=Midfield, 9,11=Forward
4. Example: Player with { defense: 18, midfield: 4, forward: 2, goalkeeper: 0 } โ assign to defense (2-5)
5. If positionHistory is null, use preferredPositions as fallback${Object.keys(nonEmptyLineup).length > 0 ? `

Current Lineup (partial):
${JSON.stringify(nonEmptyLineup, null, 2)}` : ''}${absentInjuredContext.length > 0 ? `

Absent/Injured Players:
${JSON.stringify(absentInjuredContext, null, 2)}` : ''}

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Fill ALL ${formattedQuarterInfo[1].positions.length} positions in each quarter
2. EVERY player MUST appear in at least 3 quarters
3. Assign players to their dominant position category based on positionHistory
4. Include a "substitutes" array for each quarter listing player IDs of players sitting out
