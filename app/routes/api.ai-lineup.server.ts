MATHEMATICAL CONSTRAINT:
- You have ${teamPlayers.length} total players available
- Each quarter requires ${positionsPerQuarter} players on the field
- Total player-slots across 4 quarters = ${positionsPerQuarter} ร 4 = ${totalPlayerSlots} slots
- To distribute fairly: ${totalPlayerSlots} slots รท ${teamPlayers.length} players = ~${avgQuartersPerPlayer} quarters per player
- EVERY player must appear in at least 3 quarters
- CRITICAL: Before returning your lineup, count each player ID across ALL quarters to verify compliance

General Coaching Strategy:
- Best players should typically sit out in the third quarter
- Aim for consistency between quarters - minimize position changes when possible
- Once a quarter has been completed (marked as completed: true), DO NOT modify it
- Consider each player's preferred positions and strengths from their descriptions

Current Team Format: ${team.format}
